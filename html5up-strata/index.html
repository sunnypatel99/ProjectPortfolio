				<h2>About Me!</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Sunny Patel and I am from Suwanee, Georgia. I am a third-year student at the Georgia Institute
				of Technology
				majoring in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Analytics and Data Science. I am also
				minoring in Computer Science with a focus on Computing and Intelligence. I have a strong interest
				in data analytics and over the years I have had a lot of experience with data input and manipulation.
				Below are various projects that I have worked on throughout college!

				<h3><em>January 2022</em></h3>
				<img src="images/HTML_Blog-scaled.jpeg" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">Throughout my college years, I have worked on several projects and I wanted
					to
					present
					them in a way that anyone would be able to easily access and read about them.
					I first uploaded my projects to GitHub however I felt that through a project portfolio
					website I would be able to present them in a more visually appealing way. The only HTML and CSS
					experience I had before creating this website was through web scraping using Python and
					BeautifulSoup.
					I learned how to make a website from YouTube using Github Pages and HTML templates online.
					<strong>By
						creating this
						website I was able to build a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and Github Pages.</strong>

				<h2><u>Community Outreach Consulting Project with YouthSpark</u></h2>
				<h3><em>September 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/YouthSpark.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I joined an organization called GT IISE, also
					known as the Georgia Tech
					Institute of
					Industrial and Systems Engineers. Through this organization, I was able to work with a team of 5
					students on a
					consulting project with a non-profit called YouthSpark. YouthSpark is a haven where youth who have
					suffered
					abuse, neglect, and trauma can find the legal and social support they need to begin down a positive
					path.
					One of the main issues that the organization faced was creating a dashboard that encompasses
					visualizations
					and descriptive statistics or demographics that would be easily understood by a non-technical
					audience.
					This dashboard must also appeal to stakeholders by providing specific statistics in order for
					YouthSpark
					to be able to obtain funding for their organization. My team and I were able to build an interactive
					dashboard
					using Tableau. I was able to contribute two visualizations to this dashboard.
					<strong>By participating in
						this project
						I was able to build a better understanding of Tableau as well as build upon my data input and
						manipulation skills
						with Python Pandas and Jupyter Notebook.</strong>

				<h2><u>Travel Reservations Service Project</u></h2>
				<h3><em>August 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/MySQL-Logo.wine_.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I worked on making a Travel Reservations
					Service using MySQL server
					with 4 peers
					in a class called CS 4400 Introduction to Database Systems. This project consisted of 4 phases with
					each phase
					serving as a checkpoint during the semester. In phase 1, we were assigned a scenario
					description which we had
					to translate into an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram. In phase 2, we were assigned to translate
					the EERD into
					relational schema, translate the relational schema into create table statements
					with the appropriate data types, primary and unique keys, and foreign keys, write insert statements
					to import the initial data into the tables we created, and document all unhandled constraints based
					on
					our design and implementation choices. In phase 3, we were assigned to implement 16 stored
					procedures that the system operators can utilize to modify the database state in accordance
					with various use cases as
					well as implement
					6 views that provide information to the system operators about the database state from various
					perspectives.
					Phase 4 of the project was optional and we were assigned to build a fully functional application
					integrated with
					the database system. We did not complete this part of the project however my approach would have
					been to use PyQt5,
					QtDesigner, and Python in order to build the desired Graphical User Interface.
					<strong> By working on this
						project
						throughout the fall 2021 semester, I was able to learn a lot about MySQL Server, relational
						database
						development,
						and SQL queries. </strong>

				<h2><u>Predicting Prices of the New York Stock Exchange</u></h2>
				<h3><em>November 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/Trading-floor-New-York-Stock-Exchange-City.jpeg" height=225px width=:100px
					alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I took a class called CS 4641 Machine
					Learning. In this class, we were
					assigned to
					research a problem or application in which machine learning could help. With a group of 4 peers, we
					decided to
					predict the price of the New York Stock Exchange based on previous daily price data for various
					global stock
					exchanges. We used a stock exchange dataset found on Kaggle which contained daily price data for
					indexes tracking
					stock exchanges from all over the world collected from Yahoo Finance. Predicting stock prices is
					considered extremely
					challenging due to the complex nature of the stock market. By being able to determine the future
					movement of stock
					prices, investors can make a profit while also minimizing their risk. Currently, one of the most
					commonly used stock
					prediction methods in the economic and financial fields is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated
					Moving Average) model,
					which is a statistically-based machine learning algorithm. It is known to be robust and efficient
					for time series
					forecasting in the short term. A potential problem with this method is that ARIMA assumes that the
					sequential input
					data was generated from a linear process. Thus, its prediction might be ill-suited for nonlinear
					problems. Since stock
					market behavior is highly nonlinear and exhibits uncertain behavior that changes with time, our team
					decided to implement
					a neural network-based solution, specifically using RNNs. We used univariate and multivariate LSTM
					networks which are types
					of recurrent neural networks that are structured to learn order-dependence for sequence prediction.
					A significant trend we
					discovered was that compared to ARIMA and the univariate LSTM, our multivariate LSTM consistently
					predicted trend changes
					before the other two models. This is critical to most use cases of the model like investment
					decisions or economic health
					prediction. Our best model outperforms old industry techniques that did not use neural networks.
					However, there are a variety
					of novel neural networks and other stochastic prediction models that have been developed in the last
					decade that are beyond
					the scope of our knowledge. <strong>Overall by completing this project, I was able to learn a lot
						about
						the modeling and prediction of data
						using machine learning.</strong> </p>

				<h2><u>KPMG Virtual Work Experience Program</u></h2>
				<h3><em>June 2021 - July 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/KPMG_logo.svg" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During my summer vacation after sophomore year, I completed a
					KPMG Data Analytics Consulting Virtual Internship project hosted by a platform called Forage.
					Forage is an open-access platform designed to unlock exciting careers for students by connecting
					them with company-endorsed Virtual Work Experience Programs. Virtual Work Experience Programs
					are online programs built and endorsed by leading companies. They contain a series of resources
					and tasks designed to simulate the real-world experience of starting a career. With the KPMG
					program,
					I was assigned to analyze customer and transactions data for a fictional bike store called Sprocket
					Central Pty Ltd so that they could optimize their marketing strategy. There were three phases to the
					project,
					Data Quality Assessment, Data Insights, and Data Insights and Presentation. The first phase
					consisted of
					preliminary data exploration and identifying ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty
					Ltd’s data.
					The second phase consisted of analyzing a list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics
					and
					attributes that would reveal useful customer insights which could help optimize resource allocation
					for
					targeted marketing. The third phase consisted of turning these insights into visualizations.
					<strong>By completing
						this project I was able to get a sense of what it looks like to complete a data analytics
						project in a formal
						setting as well as build upon by data input and manipulation skills with the use of Python
						Pandas, Excel,
						Jupyter Notebook, and a declarative statistical visualization library for Python called
						Altair.</strong>

				<h2><u>COVID-19 Data Analytics Project </u></h2>
				<h3><em>November 2020 - December 2020</em></h3>
				<img src="images/Coronavirus_3D_illustration_by_CDC_1600x900.png" height=225px width=:100px
					alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During my fall 2020 semester I took a class called CS 2316 Data Input and
					Manipulation where at the
					end of the
					semester we were assigned to complete a data analytics project on the topic of our choosing. With
					one peer, we
					decided to analyze the effectiveness of health expenditure as a predictor of a country's standard of
					living and COVID19
					severity. A significant motivation for this topic is the COVID19 pandemic that has affected nearly
					every country in
					the world. We wanted to see if there are factors that act as strong predictors of a country's
					handling of the
					pandemic and if they are related to the general standard of living measures. Our first goal was to
					find
					out the
					correlation between average health expenditure for each country and the total number of COVID19
					cases as a percentage
					of the population. We found that there is a negative correlation between Health Expenditures and
					COVID 19 deaths.
					We found no correlation between health expenditures and COVID 19 Cases and Tests as the data was too
					clustered.
					Our second goal was to find how strongly different measures of health expenditure like as a
					percentage of total
					GDP correlate to standard measures of standard of living. We found that health expenditure as a
					percentage of total
					GDP was a weak predictor however health expenditures in USD was a strong predictor. Our third goal
					was to compare
					measures of health expenditure to a standard measure of income inequality. We found that there is no
					correlation,
					however, health expenditure used along with GINI can be a strong predictor of the standard of
					living.
					This project is an
					example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system - extracting data from one or more sources,
					enforcing data quality
					and consistency, organizing the data in a way to provide easy access to the significant features of
					the data,
					and then exporting it back in a user-friendly format so that end users can make meaningful decisions
					from the
					results. With this project, I was able to apply all of the skills I had learned through the course
					to a pandemic
					that I was living through.
					<strong>By completing this project and the course, I was able to gain my first
						experience with
						data input and manipulation by learning Python and all of the libraries associated with
						data.</strong>

				<h2><u>Software Dev Projects</u></h2>
				<h3><em>January 2020 - May 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/Kmines_Expert_Game_with_Numbers_1-8.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During fall 2019, spring 2020, and summer 2021 semesters, I completed many
					introductory computer
					science classes such as CS 1301 Introduction to Computing and Programming, CS 1302 Software
					Development,
					and CS 1332 Data Structures and Algorithms. Over the course of these classes, I have worked on
					various software
					development projects. I implemented the Minesweeper arcade game using Java, version control, build
					management,
					debugging, and unit testing, I designed a Graphical User Interface application using JavaFX 11 and
					iTunes Search
					API on a Unix environment, and I developed and implemented various data structures and algorithms to
					learn
					Complexity Analysis.
					<strong>By taking these courses and completing assigned projects, I was able to gain a
						strong
						foundation in Java and Computer Science.</strong>
