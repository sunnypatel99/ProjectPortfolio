				<h2>About Me!</h2>
			</header>
			<p>My name is Sunny Patel and I am from Suwanee, Georgia. I am a senior at the Georgia Institute
				of Technology
				majoring in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Analytics and Data Science. I am also
				minoring in Computer Science with a focus on Computing and Intelligence. I have a strong interest
				in data analytics and over the years I have had a lot of experience with data input and manipulation.
				I am hoping to continue my passion with a Masters in Analytics starting Spring 2023. 
				Below are various projects that I have worked on throughout college! 
				<strong>The last sentence for each project is 
				bolded and highlights my main takeaways from that project.</strong>

				<h2><u>This Website</u></h2>
				<h3><em>January 2022 - Current</em></h3>
				<img src="images/HTML_Blog-scaled.jpeg" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">Throughout my college years, 
					I have worked on several projects and I wanted to present them in a way 
					where anyone can easily read about them. I first uploaded my projects to GitHub. 
					However, I felt that through a portfolio project website I would be able to present them 
					in a more visually appealing way. The only HTML and CSS experience I had before creating this 
					website was through web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup. I learned how to make a website 
					from YouTube using Github Pages and HTML templates online.
					<strong>By creating this website I was able to 
						build a better understanding of HTML, CSS, and Github Pages.</strong>

				<h2><u>Nucleic Acid Folding Problem</u></h2>
				<h3><em>April 2022 - May 2022</em></h3>
				<img src="images/NAFP.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the spring 2022 semester, I worked on solving variations of the 
					Nucleic Acid Folding Problem with 2 peers in a class called ISYE 3133 Engineering Optimization. 
					The Nucleic Acid Folding Problem is a classic problem in Computational Biology which has often been 
					solved using dynamic programming. In this project, we used Integer Linear Programming to obtain the 
					same results as the Dynamic Programming approach, and extended our model to more complex versions of 
					this problem that are harder to solve using Dynamic Programming. The file Simple_Model solves the Simple 
					Nucleic Acid Folding Problem where given a nucleotide sequence we find the maximum number of pairs. 
					Two characters are a pair if the characters in the pair are {A,U} or {C,G} and no pairs may cross. The 
					picture above is an example of a solution to the simple model. The next file Simple_Enhancements adds 
					biological enhancements to our model where the minimum distance between pairs must be at least 3 away, 
					different pairs have a stronger weight, and we allow non-complementary matched pairs {G,U} and {A,C}. 
					The next file Base_Stacking adds the enhancement of quartets where two pairs are next to each other and 
					this allows a Nucleic Acid Fold to be stronger. For example in the picture above {C,G}, {A,U}, and {U,A} 
					make up 2 stacked quartets. The next file Weighted_Stacked adds the enhancement that some stacked quartets 
					have a stronger weight than others. The next file position_quartet adds the enhancement that the positioning 
					of a quartet within a stack may have a larger weight. The final file Crossing_10 combines all the 
					enhancements and allows 10 intersections between pairs.
					<strong>By completing this project and class, I was able to learn about Operations Research and the 
						formulation of constrained decision-making models to solve real life problems with the use 
						of Gurobi.</strong>

				<h2><u>Small Bank Branch Case Study</u></h2>
				<h3><em>April 2022 - May 2022</em></h3>
				<img src="images/SIMIO.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the spring 2022 semester, I worked on a Small Bank Branch Case Study 
					with 3 peers in a class called ISYE 3044 Simulation Analysis and Design. We used SIMIO to model the bank 
					branch which is open from 9:00am to 5:00pm on weekdays and consists of an ATM, tellers, and a manager. 
					There are 4 types of customers with customers just going to the ATM, Teller, or Manager, and customers 
					either going to the ATM or Teller depending on which line is the shortest. The project outlined different 
					criteria for when a customer is unhappy. If the queue lengths are too long or if they wait in a queue for 
					too long then a customer will become unhappy. For every unhappy customer the bank loses $100. The bank has 
					to figure out how many tellers to have during each shift and how many ATMs they should have to reduce the 
					number of unhappy customers. However, purchasing ATMs and hiring more tellers results in an increase in 
					overall costs. My team and I modeled the bank in SIMIO and used OptQuest to find the optimal conditions 
					that would reduce overall costs for the bank resulting from unhappy customers, purchases of additional 
					equipment, and hiring of inexperienced/experienced staff. 
					<strong>By completing this project and class, I was able 
						to develop an understanding of Simulation Modeling as a tool for operations research.</strong>

				<h2><u>Community Outreach Consulting Project with YouthSpark</u></h2>
				<h3><em>September 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/YouthSpark.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I joined an organization called GT IISE, also known 
					as Georgia Tech Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers. Through this organization, I was able to work 
					with a team of 5 students on a consulting project with a non-profit called YouthSpark. YouthSpark is a haven 
					where youth who have suffered abuse, neglect, and trauma can find the legal and social support they need to 
					begin down a positive path. One of the main issues that the organization faced was creating a dashboard that
					encompasses visualizations and descriptive statistics or demographics that would be easily understood by a 
					non-technical audience. This dashboard must also appeal to stakeholders by providing specific statistics in
					 order for YouthSpark to be able to obtain funding for their organization. My team and I were able to build 
					 an interactive dashboard using Tableau. I was able to contribute two visualizations to this dashboard. 
					<strong>By 
						participating in this project I was able to build a better understanding of Tableau as well as build upon 
						my data input and manipulation skills with Python Pandas and Jupyter Notebook. </strong>

				<h2><u>Travel Reservations Service Project</u></h2>
				<h3><em>August 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/MySQL-Logo.wine_.png" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I worked on making a Travel Reservations Service 
					using MySQL server with 4 peers in a class called CS 4400 Introduction to Database Systems. This project 
					consisted of 4 phases with each phase serving as a checkpoint during the semester. In phase 1, we were 
					assigned with a scenario description which we had to translate into an Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagram. 
					In phase 2, we were assigned to translate the EERD into relational schema; translate the relational schema 
					into create table statements
					with appropriate data types, primary, unique, and foreign keys; write insert statements to import the 
					initial data into the tables we created, and document all unhandled constraints based on our design and 
					implementation choices. In phase 3, we were assigned to implement 16 stored procedures which allow the system 
					operators to modify the database state in accordance with various use cases, and implement 6 views which provide 
					information to the system operators about the database state from various perspectives. Phase 4 of the project was 
					optional and we were assigned to build a fully functional application integrated with the database system. We did 
					not complete this part of the project however my approach would have been to use PyQt5, QtDesigner, and Python in 
					order to build the desired Graphical User Interface. 
					<strong> By working on this project throughout the fall 2021 semester, 
						I was able to learn a lot about MySQL Server, relational database development, and SQL queries.  </strong>

				<h2><u>Predicting Prices of the New York Stock Exchange</u></h2>
				<h3><em>November 2021 - December 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/Trading-floor-New-York-Stock-Exchange-City.jpeg" height=225px width=:100px
					alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During the fall 2021 semester, I took a class called CS 4641 Machine Learning. 
					In this class, we were assigned to research a problem or application in which machine learning would help. 
					With a group of 4 peers, we decided to predict the price of the New York Stock Exchange for various global 
					stock exchanges based on previous daily price data. We used a stock exchange dataset from Kaggle which 
					containes daily price data collected from Yahoo Finance for indexes tracking stock exchanges from all over
					 the world. Predicting stock prices is considered extremely challenging due to the complex nature of the 
					 stock market. By being able to determine the future movement of stock prices, investors can make profit 
					 while also minimize their risk. Currently, one of the most commonly used stock prediction methods in the 
					 economic and financial fields is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which is a 
					 statistically-based machine learning algorithm. It is known to be robust and efficient for time series 
					 forecasting in the short term. A potential problem with this method is that ARIMA assumes that the 
					 sequential input data was generated from a linear process. Thus, its prediction might be ill-suited 
					 for nonlinear problems. Since stock market behavior is highly nonlinear and exhibits uncertain behavior 
					 that changes with time, our team decided to implement a neural network-based solution, specifically 
					 using RNNs. We used univariate and multivariate LSTM networks which are types of recurrent neural networks
					  that are structured to learn order-dependence for sequence prediction. A significant trend we discovered 
					  was that compared to ARIMA and the univariate LSTM, our multivariate LSTM consistently predicted trend 
					  changes before the other two models. This is critical to most use cases of the model like investment 
					  decisions or economic health prediction. Our best model out performs old industry techniques that did 
					  not use neural networks. However there are a variety of novel neural networks and other stochastic 
					  prediction models that have been developed in the last decade that were beyond the scope of our knowledge. 
			 <strong>Overall by completing this project, I was able to learn a lot about modeling and prediction of data using 
				machine learning. </strong> </p>

				<h2><u>KPMG Virtual Work Experience Program</u></h2>
				<h3><em>June 2021 - July 2021</em></h3>
				<img src="images/KPMG_logo.svg" height=225px width=:100px alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During summer after my sophomore year, I completed a KPMG Data Analytics 
					Consulting Virtual Internship project hosted by a platform called Forage. Forage is an open access 
					platform designed to unlock exciting careers for students by connecting them with company-endorsed 
					Virtual Work Experience Programs. Virtual Work Experience Programs are online programs built and 
					endorsed by leading companies. They contain a series of resources and tasks designed to simulate 
					the real-world experience of starting a career. With the KPMG program, I was assigned to analyze 
					customer and transactions data for a fictional bike store called Sprocket Central Pty. Ltd so that 
					they could optimize their marketing strategy. There were three phases to the project, Data Quality 
					Assessment, Data Insights, and Presentation of Data Insights. The first phase consisted of preliminary 
					data exploration and identifying ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty. Ltd’s data. 
					The second phase consisted of analyzing a list of 1000 potential customers to obtain useful customer 
					insights which would in return optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing. The third phase 
					consisted of turning these insights into visualizations. 
					<strong>By completing this project, I was able to get 
						a sense of what it looks like to complete a data analytics project in a formal setting, and build on my 
						data input and manipulation skills through the use of Python Pandas, Excel, Jupyter Notebook, and a 
						declarative statistical visualization library for Python called Altair. </strong>

				<h2><u>COVID-19 Data Analytics Project </u></h2>

				<img src="images/Coronavirus_3D_illustration_by_CDC_1600x900.png" height=225px width=:100px
					alt="" /></a>
				<p style="font-size:16px;">During my fall 2020 semester, I took a class called CS 2316 Data Input and 
					Manipulation where at the end of the semester we were assigned to complete a data analytics project on 
					a topic of our choosing. With one peer, we decided to analyze effectiveness of health expenditure as a 
					predictor of a country's standard of living and COVID19 severity. A significant motivation for this topic 
					was the COVID19 pandemic that has affected nearly every country in the world. We wanted to see if there are 
					factors that act as strong predictors of a country's handling of the pandemic and if they are related to 
					general standard of living measures. Our first goal was to find out the correlation between average health 
					expenditure for each country and the total number of COVID19 cases as a percentage of the population. We 
					found that there is a negative correltion between Health Expenditures and COVID 19 deaths. We found no 
					correlation between health expenditures and COVID 19 Cases and Tests as the data was too clustered. Our 
					second goal was to find how strongly different measures of health expenditure a percentage of total GDP 
					correlate to standard measures of standard of living. We found that health expenditure as a percentage 
					of total GDP was a weak predictor however health expenditures in USD was a strong predictor. Our third 
					goal was to compare measures of health expenditure to a standard measure of income inequality. We found 
					that there is no correlation. However, health expenditure used along with GINI can be a strong predictor 
					of standard of living. This project is an example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) system - extracting 
					data from one or more sources, enforcing data quality and consistency, organizing the data in a way to 
					provide easy access to the significant features of the data, and then exporting it back in a user-friendly 
					format so that end users can make meaningful decisions from the results. With this project I was able to 
					apply all of the skills I had learned through the course onto a pandemic that I was living through. 
					<strong>By 
						completing this project and the course, I was able to gain my first experience with data input and 
						manipulation through Python. </strong>

					Over the course of these classes I have worked on various software development projects. I implemented 
					the Minesweeper arcade game using Java, version control, build management, debugging, and unit testing; 
					I designed a Graphical User Interface application using JavaFx 11 and iTunes Search API on a Unix 
					environment, and I developed and implemented various data structures and algorithms to learn Complexity 
					Analysis. 
					<strong>By taking these courses and completing assigned projects, I was able to gain a strong foundation
